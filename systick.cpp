/** @brief This is the systick event - an ISR connected to Timer 2
 * Running at 500Hz, the systick interrupt handles all the regular
 * control updates including
 *   - switch debounce
 *   - speed and odometry updates from the encoders
 *   - speed control of the robot
 *   - such other tasks as may be required from time to time
 * At the end of each systck interrupt, the ADC interrupt is enables and
 * an ADC conversion started. This begins the sensor read cycle. Details
 * are in ISR(ADC_vect)
 *
 * The code running in the systck interrupt should execute as fast as possible
 * and should not run for more than about 500us in total to avoid excessive
 * system load.
 *
 * NOTE: during the systick interrupt service global interrupts are enabled
 * so that higher priority interrupts from the encoderd and UART can be serviced.
 * These will impact total run time for this ISR and care must be taken when
 * handling values that may be changed by these other iterrupt sources.
 *
 * For testing, the built-in LED can be turned on at the start of the interrupt
 * and off again at the end. This can be used to measure system load.
 * Disable the feature if you want to use the built-in LED for some other
 * purpose.
